## Workflow Description
1. A new task or user request is initiated within ServiceNow.  
2. The system automatically assigns the request to the appropriate group based on defined roles.  
3. A workflow triggers the approval process and updates the task status.  
4. The approver reviews and approves or rejects the request.  
5. Upon approval, the task moves to the next status, and notifications are sent automatically.
