**Ideation Phase Documentation**

This folder contains the initial brainstorming and ideation materials for the project “Optimizing User, Group, and Role Management with Access Control and Workflows.”
The ideation phase established the foundation of the project by identifying existing challenges in ServiceNow user management and defining a focused problem statement and solution direction.

**Contents**

Brainstorming – Idea Generation – Prioritization Template.pdf
Includes brainstorming notes, idea generation, and prioritization of key concepts related to user, role, and group management automation.

Define Problem Statement.pdf
Provides an in-depth analysis of the core problem, emphasizing the lack of structured access control, workflow automation, and clear role distribution in project environments.

Empathy Map Canvas.pdf
Visualizes the perspectives, challenges, and needs of project team members (e.g., Project Manager and Team Member) to understand workflow pain points and define user-centric solutions.

**Ideation Process**

The ideation phase aimed to uncover bottlenecks in user, group, and role management within ServiceNow, particularly for project management teams that require transparent task ownership and controlled access.
Key steps included:

Identifying inefficiencies in manual task assignments and approvals.

Mapping user needs through empathy mapping and brainstorming sessions.

Defining a problem statement aligned with ServiceNow’s automation capabilities.

Prioritizing feasible ideas that could be implemented using ACLs, Flow Designer, and role-based workflows.

This phase helped frame the project’s direction toward designing a secure, automated, and role-based management system to enhance accountability and streamline collaboration.
