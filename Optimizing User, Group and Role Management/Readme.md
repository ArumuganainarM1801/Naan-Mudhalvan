#Optimizing User, Group, and Role Management with Access Control and Workflows

**Project Overview**

This ServiceNow project focuses on optimizing User, Group, and Role Management by implementing structured Access Control Lists (ACLs) and automated workflows through Flow Designer.
It enables efficient project collaboration by assigning role-based access, defining clear responsibilities, and automating task approvals between project team members.
The solution ensures accountability, transparency, and secure data handling across all project activities.

**Team Details**

Team ID: NM2025TMID01508

Team Size: 4 Members

Team Leader: Arumuganainar M

Team Members: Kingslin Gibson E, Immanuel K, David Solomonraj M


**Key Features**

User, Group, and Role Management
Create and manage users (e.g., Alice, Bob) with defined roles like Project Member and Team Member to ensure clear role boundaries.

Access Control List (ACL) Configuration
Enforce security by defining granular access rights at the table and field level (e.g., restrict Comment and Status fields for specific roles).

Automated Workflows using Flow Designer
Build and test flows to automate approval and task completion — for instance, when a task’s status changes to In Progress, it automatically triggers approval by the project manager.

Role-based Application Access
Provide controlled access to Project Table and Task Table applications, ensuring users only interact with modules relevant to their roles.

Task Management with Approval Processes
Streamlined workflow where Bob (Team Member) performs tasks and Alice (Project Manager) reviews and approves them, improving accountability and tracking.

**Technology Used**

Platform: ServiceNow

Modules: System Security, Flow Designer, Access Control List, User Administration

Roles: Project Member, Team Member

Tools: Flow Designer for workflow automation, ACLs for data security

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the successful implementation of role-based access control and workflow automation within ServiceNow.

By defining structured user roles, applying ACLs, and automating task approvals, the system enhances team collaboration, minimizes manual intervention, and ensures smooth and secure project execution.
