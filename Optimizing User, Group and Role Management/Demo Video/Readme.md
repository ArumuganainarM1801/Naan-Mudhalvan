## Workflow Summary
1. A **user request** or **task** is raised in the ServiceNow platform.  
2. The system automatically **assigns the task** to a specific group based on user roles.  
3. A **workflow** triggers an **approval process** for the assigned user/group.  
4. Once approved, the task status changes to **"In Progress"**, and progress is tracked.  
5. Notifications are sent to relevant users upon **status updates** or **approvals**.
